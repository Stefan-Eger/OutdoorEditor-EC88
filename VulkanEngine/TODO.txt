3.2)Implement Save
3.3)Implement Load -> Reconstruct Scene from saved Data in the JSON file

Bugfixing 
-> Notify neighbors if voxel is removed or added -> Done (16.11.21)
-> add switching (textures) materials for voxels
-> remove mesh artifacts if possible
-> Refactor raytracing code

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Place/Create Objects Like Trees, Stones, Bushes, Grass and so on (Models or Procedural Generation)
4.1) Create a Tree Model -> Done (21.11.21)
4.2) Implement Model Via VVE
4.3) Place Model in Editor
4.4) Create more models in blender

5) Implement SurfaceNets

6) Implement Rivers

Questions:
1) Git Branch no Permissions for pushing tried https and SSH? -> own repository

2) Is PBR the goal or are artistic versions also ok? -> both ok

3) Models for Content like Trees or using Algorithms? -> A Tree with many branches and cut off branches via algorithm

4) Is VEWindowGLFW change ok? -> yes
	
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Questions 2
1)Found Bug in VESubrenderFW::removeEntity
2)Git is private and is it ok?
3)Weird Mesh generating artifacts -> what causes it are they normal
4)Preferences in terrain editing?
